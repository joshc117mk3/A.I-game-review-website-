# A.I-game-review-website-

Overview
A website for gathering non-political/ideological game reviews.

It will also have an AI that uses a user's given data on games and genres they like to suggest similar games, including both free-to-play and paid titles, while finding the cheapest price for paid games.

The system will filter reviews across multiple sites, avoiding all reviews that contain political or ideological opinions. It will use data such as player count, average playtime, and reviews to make personalized suggestions. Additionally, it will learn from user feedback, improving its recommendations over time.

The goal is to provide unbiased game suggestions. It will also attempt to ignore review bombing, further filtering out political/ideological influences, as well as backlash towards game studios for reasons unrelated to the quality of the game itself.

Outcome
To create a system that allows games to be reviewed fairly, based solely on:

Is the game fun?
Is the game polished?
Is it worth the time and money?
Politics and ideologies have no place in gaming unless they are fictional and not a reflection of the real world, which gamers seek to escape from.

This system will allow developers to see reviews about their games rather than real-world issues and ensure that players donâ€™t have to worry about a game being an exercise in politics or "wokeness."
